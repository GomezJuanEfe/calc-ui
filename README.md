## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

2. Install dependencies:

3. Run server:

## The Process üèãÔ∏è

### Code reusing

For many features on the application I used code from different people. In this section I want to acknowledge to Justin Schroeder and Mireille Tijdeman. Check on the links section which part of their work helped and inspired me to do this job.

### Mobile no hover

One of the things you may ask is how to deactivate the hover on mobile devices. Here we have two approaches:

Where the current device has a cursor that can hover.

```css
@media (hover: hover) {
  a:hover {
    /* hover styles */
  }
}
```

Applying styles only to devices that do not support hovering.

```css
@media (hover: none) {
  /* styles for touchscreen devices */
}
```

### Configuring GH-Pages for deploying

This part was very challenging cause I had to understand very well the vite config in order to deploy the project on GitHub Pages.

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: "/calc-ui/",
  server: {
    host: "https://gomezjuanefe.github.io/",
  },
  build: {
    outDir: "dist",
  },
});
```
